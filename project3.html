        <!-- Starting the Design -->
        <section id="starting_design" class="project-section">
            <h2>Starting the Design</h2>
            <p>As I transition from research to design, the first step in bringing the art appraiser's website to life is the creation of paper wireframes. This stage involves sketching preliminary layouts that visualize the structure and functionality of the website, serving as a blueprint for the digital design process. Paper wireframes allow me to experiment with different layouts and design elements quickly and inexpensively, facilitating early feedback and iteration.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="image-gallery">
                <img src="PW1.png" alt="Image 1">
                <img src="PW2.png" alt="Image 2">
                <img src="PW3.png" alt="Image 3">
                <img src="PW4.png" alt="Image 4">

                <img src="PW6.png" alt="Image 6">
            </div>


	    <h2>Digital Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Following the completion of paper wireframes, the next step in the design process is to create digital wireframes. This stage involves transitioning from rough sketches to more polished, computer-generated layouts that provide a clearer visualization of the website’s structure and functionality. Digital wireframes serve as an intermediary step between paper sketches and high-fidelity prototypes, allowing me to refine design elements and further develop the user experience.</p>
            <img src="LO FI MOCKUPS_ON.png" alt="Low Fidelity Mockups" class="project-image">


	    <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p>After developing digital wireframes, the next step in the design process is to create a low-fidelity prototype. This stage involves transforming static wireframes into an interactive prototype that simulates the user experience. A low-fidelity prototype provides a basic yet functional representation of the website, allowing me to test user flows and gather early feedback on the overall design and usability.</p>

	    <h2>Usability Study</h2>
            <p>As part of the design validation process, I conducted an <strong>online moderated</strong> usability study to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of the prototype. Using video conferencing tools and screen sharing, I was able to observe participants’ interactions and gather insights efficiently. <strong>Five participants</strong> were selected to represent a mix of art collectors and emerging artists, ensuring diverse perspectives and feedback on the prototype. Each session lasted <strong>between 10 to 15 minutes</strong>, providing a focused yet comprehensive evaluation of the prototype’s usability.</p>

<p>Below, the key findings:</p>

        <!-- Refining Design -->
        <section id="refining_design" class="project-section">

            <h2>Refining Design</h2>

<p>After completing the usability study and gathering valuable feedback, the next phase in the design process involved refining the website’s design to ensure it aligns with the client’s vision and user needs. This phase included several key steps: creating a moodboard, developing mockups, and building a high-fidelity prototype.</p>

<p>To establish a cohesive visual identity for the website, I collaborated with the client to create a moodboard. This initial step involved selecting a range of images, color palettes, typography styles, and design elements that reflect the desired aesthetic and emotional tone of the site. The moodboard served as a reference point for defining the overall look and feel, ensuring that the website evokes the right emotions and aligns with the client’s brand identity.</p>

<!-- Moodboard Image -->
            <img src="MOODBOARD_ON.png" alt="ON Moodboard" class="project-image">
        </section>

<p>The moodboard helped establish the visual direction, including design elements that evoke trust, expertise, and elegance. This foundation guided the development of subsequent design stages.</p>

<p>Building on the moodboard, I created detailed mockups of the website’s key pages. Mockups are static representations of the website’s layout and design, providing a clear view of how the finalized design will look. This step involved applying the color palette and design elements defined in the moodboard to create high-fidelity visual representations of the website’s pages.</p>

<!-- Mockups Image -->

            <img src="MOCKUPS OCTAVIO NAVARRO.png" alt="ON Moodboard" class="project-image">

<p>Mockups were presented to the client for feedback, allowing for adjustments and final approval before moving on to the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

            <h2>Design System</h2>
<p>In this section of the UX design case study, we delve into the creation and implementation of the design system that underpins the user interface of our project. The design system serves as the foundational framework for maintaining consistency, efficiency, and cohesiveness throughout the application, ensuring that all design elements align with the overall vision and user experience goals.</p>

            <h2>High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>

<p>With the mockups approved, I proceeded to develop the hi-fi protoype. This interactive version of the design incorporates realistic visual details and functional elements, providing a comprehensive simulation of the final website, allowing for detailed testing of interactions, user flows, and overall usability. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/x5tW6FeQ4anyQIUcFtoylw/Octavio-Navarro-Computadora?node-id=114-73&starting-point-node-id=114%3A73&t=wZfyHjhRW8QCSnk0-1" class="highlight" target="_blank">Click here to check the high-fidelity prototype.</a></p>

            <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

<p>Accessibility considerations were integrated throughout the design refinement process to ensure the website is usable by individuals with varying abilities. Applying accessibility standards helps create an inclusive experience and ensures compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.</p>
